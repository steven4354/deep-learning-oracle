# Deep Learning with Pytorch

Doing the exercises from "Deep Learning with Pytorch". [Amazon link](https://amazon.com)

TODO:
- do a jupyter notebook for chapter 1

## Getting started

```bash
python venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Make sure to save new deps when installing new ones
```bash
pip freeze requirements.txt
```

## Additional notes

### Topics covered

#### Deep learning with pytorch (textbook)

long short-term memory (LSTM) modules: no, says out of scope of the book to cover

recurrent neural networks: yes

transformer networks: no, says out of scope of the book to cover

attention: no

CNN: yes

encoder/decoder: no

Sequence Transduction Models: ??

#### Generative deep learning (textbook)

transformer networks: yes

long short-term memory (LSTM) model: yes, one or two exercises to train one from scratch

attention: yes (basically the transformer chapter)

encoder/decoder: yes

Sequence Transduction Models: ??
